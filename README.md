# pygame-chinese-checkers

WARNING: This is not a complete project. It contains a lot of bugs.

You can run `main.py` if you have `pygame-ce` and `PySide6` installed.
If not, install them first with:
```python3 -m pip install -U pygame-ce PySide6```

To run it, first open a terminal at the folder where this project is saved at, then use `python3 main.py` to start the game. Without any editing, the game should be you (yellow, going first) versus one bot (green).

When the game ends, you have to manually quit the game by clicking the X button on the top right corner (or top left, depending on your OS), or go to the terminal and press ctrl-C or command-C.
