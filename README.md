# pygame-chinese-checkers

WARNING: This is not a complete project. Some functionalities have not been implemented yet. You may encounter bugs.

I'm using Python 3.9 to test this project. It requires at least Python 3.7+.

You can run `main.py` if you have `pygame-ce` and `PySide6` installed.
If not, install them first with:
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame-ce PySide6
```

To run it, first open a terminal at the folder where this project is saved at, then use `python3 main.py` to start the game. If nothing goes wrong, the game should prompt you to select players after clicking Play.

When the game ends, you have to manually quit the game by clicking the X button on the top right corner (or top left, depending on your OS), or go to the terminal and press ctrl-C or command-C.

Replay system has not been implemented yet.
